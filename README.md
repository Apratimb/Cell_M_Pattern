# Cell_M_Pattern
Collective cell migration is responsible for a multitude of biological processes, e.g. embryonic development, wound healing, tissue remodelling and cancer progression. One of the modes of cell migration is called coherent angular motion (CAM) where cells move collectively in vortices. Following code is the implementation of cohenerent angular motion in MATLAB.
